### Usage

[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is a symlink farm manager that can be used to take the packages in this repository and stow them in separate directories easily. An example:

```bash
stow bash tmux nvim vim
```

If this repository is cloned in your home directory (and you are this repository), this command creates symlinks to all files inside the packages ``bash`` ``tmux`` ``nvim`` and ``vim`` here in your home directory, in the exact structure seen inside each package. By default, stow takes the current directory as the ```stow directory``` and the parent directory as the ```target directory```.
